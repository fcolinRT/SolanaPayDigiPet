# Loyalty Program done the right way in WEB3
### DigiPets

### Why we built it  
Loyalty programs will change the way we interact with a business. 
However, giving discounts devalues a business as a cheap alternative. 
A business doesn't get a customer after offering a discount but a bargain finder which will not be a loyal customer. 
Today more than ever, businesses CAN NOT afford discounts; margins are already low, cost of goods high, labor is hard to find
and asking businesses to get another tablet and train their staff on a new device to take crypto and give away discounts. 
Not an ideal incentive for the merchant. 
#### We need a win-win strategy. 

### Loyalty Programs of the Future with DigiPets
Instead, let's gamify the loyalty program while educating new adopters. 
Imagine Tamagotchi and foursquare together.

When you come and pay using Solana Pay for the first time, you get an egg, congrats on your first NFT! 

The second time you paid with Solana Pay, we noticed you already have our NFT. You get a coin. Congrats on your first coin! 
For each purchase, you will get coins that you can later use to personalize and evolve your NFT!

You can select the properties for your NFT, and once in a while, we will let you know at what location we are dropping a very rare egg that can give you a rare NFT.

You can grow and nurture your baby NFT, or you can sell and trade it!

#### Result
This way, merchants are incentivized to add a new payment method since they don't have to pay anything. Customers are more incentivized to pay with crypto because now they get cashback and they can evolve their NFT, sell or trade it too.
